Pokemon Card Price Scraper.
This program scrapes the prices of Pokemon cards saved in a CSV file from a card collecting website. The purpose of this project was to improve one of the first programs I ever made using the help of ChatGPT.

How it Works.
Selenium is used to extract data from the card collecting website and save it to a CSV file. The CSV file should be formatted with the name of the card in the first column, the set of the card in the second column, and the card number in the third column.

Improvements Made.
The original code has been improved both in terms of functionality and readability. The program now looks and works much better than before. Parts of the code that were changed are annotated
